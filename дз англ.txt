a)Hey now I must say I hate people being late I always try to arrive exactly on time myself I think it's very rude to be late don't you Florence my friends are quite often late personally I think you should arrive within an hour of the time that you are invited but some of my friends are much later than that but I think the most important thing is to stay in touch and let the person know if you're going to be late just send a text or whatever well then it's not such a problem hopefully well I must say it's a problem for me when I meeting you next time Gran I'll make sure I'm not late I don't want to get into trouble
